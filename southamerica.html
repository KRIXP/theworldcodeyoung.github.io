 NO 5 <P><H1>AMAZON RAINFOREST of THE GREAT "SOUTH AMERICA"</H1></P>
 <img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*b1c3WQbj10hOltDefpL5YQ.png"
   
 <p><h1><pre>
  1. The Amazon is a vast region that spans across eight rapidly
   developing countries: Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia,
    Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname and French Guiana.
  2.The Amazon Rainforest covers 3.4 million square miles - this is less 
  than 2% of the Earth's surface, yet this space produces more
   than 10 times that amounts worth of the world's oxygen!.
  3.It is the world's largest tropical rainforest, and home to
   approximately 40,000 plant species and 1,300 bird species. 
    You will find so many interesting and diverse creatures lurking
     the forest floor, or moving from tree to tree.  .
  4.While there may be some animals within the Amazon 
  that are gentle and friendly, there are definitely a 
  few that you want to keep your distance from.
    What would you do if you saw an electric eels, 
    flesh eating piranhas, or jaguar?.
   5. Another fascinating feature of this amazing
    rainforest is the size of the river that flows through it.
      It covers approximately 2,000 miles - that's about the
       distance between Shelburne, Vermont, and Houston, Texas.
   6.The Amazon is referred to as the "Lungs of the Earth",
    and with good reason.  More than 20% of the world's oxygen 
    is produced here.
